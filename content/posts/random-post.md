**Write them down in an easily accessible place.** This entire post boils down to this one and essential step. You can reflect as much as you want, but during those moments of lows and friction, reflection gets pushed into the back of your mind.[^1] To retrieve that information, it often takes a lot of brain power and mental strength to reach back there and pull out useful tidbits. So plan for this. Write your ideas down to reduce the friction between possible solutions and you taking action on them. This is similar to Julian Lehr's post on [A Meta-Layer for Notes](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/), where he describes a spatial note taking app that flows through our workspace, appearing in relevant contexts. In this case, I am advocating for notes that are tied to affective states. You can refer to these notes for help, and update them with your experiences.

To give a concrete example, here are my notes for my distracted state. I begin with trying to figure out what leads to this state, whether by researching online to find scientific results, or by reflecting on past experience. Then I find helpful actions and can refer to them when I get distracted.

[^1]: Why? Reflection is difficult, and during these situations, your brain reaches for the easier and instantaneous "cures".
